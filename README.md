### 🥷 About Me

I'm a code ninja on a mission to prove that technology can be smart and playful. I strive to create solutions that simplify life—plus, I firmly believe even bugs deserve a clever punchline.

- 🔥 Turning coffee into Python and Django magic (with a sprinkle of AI)
- 🛠️ Debugging like a pro and building chatbots with a sense of humor
- 💡 Believer in smart, simple, and a little bit silly tech

### ☕ Fun Fact

When I’m not fighting bugs, I’m perfecting the art of making the perfect cup of coffee.  
(I once told my code, “I need space,” and it responded with a recursion joke that left me in stitches!)
